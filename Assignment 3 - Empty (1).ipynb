    "This notebook is meant for you to review and reflect on the content of Lecture 3, which was mainly about unsupervised learning problems. As with last week, this notebook should not be too much quantitative work (lines of code) but keep in mind that running this notebook may take a longer time than you may be used to for python programs (*training good models take time!*) \n",

    "### Handing in your Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is an invaluable resource to researchers and developers, and thus for this course, all course material will be (additionally) shared on GitHub. Though there is a tiny bit of a learning curve, this is worth the effort. To hand in your assignment (applicable to all weeks):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a folder called \"Week 2\" and copy this notebook and any other files or data that may be needed.\n",
    "2. Finish the notebook and commit and push regularly. Your final commit before the deadline will be graded. \n",

    "Each one of the (sub-)questions below will be graded either 0 (insufficient), 1 (sufficient) or 2 (good). If $N$ is the number of sub-questions, and $p_i$ is your score for sub-question $i$, your total grade $G$ for this assignment is:\n",

    "If you are happy with your score and wish to see how well it is doing with respect to other people (a sort of mini-competition), fill out the following form with the train_score (accuracy$\\in[0,1]$), test_score (accuracy$\\in[0,1]$), mean training time (in seconds), and mean inference time (in seconds) of your model, as well as what method you use. You can submit as many times before the deadline as you wish. Your final results will be correlated with your submission in order to validate your results (if we cannot validate them, they will be immediately disqualified).\n",
